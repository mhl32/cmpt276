Cash: Scattered throughout the bank to increase the score.

üïπÔ∏è Gameplay Mechanics
Thief Movement

        Controls:

        Press W to move up.

        Press A to move left.

        Press S to move down.

        Press D to move right.

Preconditions: There must be a valid, unoccupied cell in the direction the thief intends to move.

Exceptions: Pressing any key other than W, A, S, or D results in no movement.

Interactions
        
Fire:

        If the thief moves into a cell containing fire, they take damage.

        Multiple fire cells can reduce the thief's health to zero, resulting in game over.

Cop:

        If the thief moves into a cell containing a cop, they are caught, and the game ends.

Barrier:

        If the thief attempts to move into a cell with a barrier, they remain in their current position.

Cash Reward:

        If the thief moves into a cell containing cash, they collect the reward, increasing their score.

Bonus Safe:

        If the thief moves into a cell containing the bonus safe, they collect it, significantly boosting their score.

Health & Game Over

        The thief starts with full health.

        Health decreases when walking into fire or being caught by a cop.

        If health reaches zero, the game ends.
